----------

Write a program in assembly to accomplish the following:

1. Prompt the user to enter an array of non-negative integers. The array should have a length of at least 25 elements. 

If the user enters less than 25 elements and/or enters elements that are not non-negative integers, display an error message and re-prompt the user to enter a valid length.

2. Next use a function to search through the array named to find the following:

    a. Minimum Array Value
  
    b. Maximum Array Value

Display the minimum and maximum values with appropriate introductory text.

4. Calculate and display the average value of the array with appropriate introductory text.

5. Use a function to traverse the array and find all the odd array values.

Place these values, in ascending order, in a new array named “odds”.

Display the odds array with appropriate introductory text

6. Use a function to traverse the array and find all the even array values.

Place these values, in ascending order, in a new array named “evens”.

Display the evens array with appropriate introductory text.

7. Provide the user with the option to repeat the program or quit.

Parameters are to be passed to functions using the stack.
